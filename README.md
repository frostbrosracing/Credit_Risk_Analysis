# Credit Risk Analysis using 6 Different Methods

## Project Overview of the Analysis
#### The goal of this project was to analyze the outcomes of six different methods of evaluating credit risk.
Using a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company, each of the methods was used to create training and target variables and then make predictions through the use of the `LogisticRegression` classifier.  The accuracy of each model's performance was then evaluated by the calculation of an accuracy score of those predictions.  Finally, a confusion matrix was generated in which the predictions were assigned based on their accuracy and an imbalanced classification report was printed out.
